# startsmall tracker

This project is a Twitter bot that tracks Jack Dorsey's #startsmall 
charitable donations and prints them. I was curious to see how the
follow-through was a week after he announced the donations and was
pleased to see more money going to good causes; then I decided I
didn't want to check the Google doc he's using every few days.

I also took the liberty of creating a shortened URL for his sheet.
